# HK OSM project

This is a Large-scale spatio-temporal data project for UROP1100H project. The code based on another github repository "show-route-webapp": (https://github.com/RAJAVEL-M/show-route-webapp) published by Rajavel M (https://github.com/RAJAVEL-M).

This project has serval functions including show route between two points(original project's function); visualize data on Open Street Map and generate forms according input data. 
A newly added function is that it could show the latest seven-days Covid-related buildings information according to HK gov's data. But with the fixed data pre-processed. So we could further improve it by directdely request data from website and do a real-time demo.
